# Reading and Writing CSV file in spark-dotnet

To run this:

dotnet build
cd bin/debug/netcoreapp2.1 (or whatever your output directory is)
spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.deploy.DotnetRunner  --master local ./microsoft-spark-2.4.x-0.3.0.jar dotnet split-csv.dll

This will read in the source.csv file - partition it by city and write out a number of csv files (at least one per city!)
